        <h1>The Solar System</h1>
        <p>The Solar System is where our Earth is located in. According to modern science, the Solar System consists of the Sun, many stars, many bodies, and eight major planets. They are named Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. All eight of them orbit the Sun, and that is how we call this region the Solar System. In fact, the Sun is so huge that it accounts for more than <em>99%</em> of the entire masses that exist in the Solar System.</p>
        <p>The Sun is formally called a G-type main-sequence star, a star that is vibrant and will live long. It is huge, but still smaller than some other stars beyond the Solar System. The Sun is mainly made of gases, especially hydrogen and helium, and it continuously emits heat through <em>nuclear fusions</em>. The Sun started off a few billions of years ago from molecular clouds through gravitational force. Like all other stars, the Sun has a limited life too, but it will stay the way we see it within another few billion years.</p>

        <p>Next to the Sun, there are the four <em>terrestrial planets</em>, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They are defined by how they are relatively dense in mass, and they are mainly a combination of rock and water. Mercury and Venus are mainly rocky and for their proximity to the Sun they are hot and dry. Earth, as we know, is full of rock and water, and the Poles are icy during different seasons. Mars is also rocky with limited ice/water. The Earth has only one Moon or satellite, whereas Mars has two, and Mercury and Venus have none. Within the Solar System, only the space around the Earth is known as a habitable zone where water can exist consistently for life to exist and evolve.</p>

        <h4>The list of Solar System bodies goes like this starting with the Sun:</h4>
        <h3>Sun</h3>
        <li>Mercury</li>
        <li>Venus</li>
        <li>Earth</li>
        <li>Mars</li>

        <p>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are collectively called <em>giant planets</em>. They are massive and far larger than the above terrestrial planets but are less dense in mass. Jupiter and Saturn are the two largest planets and contain mainly hydrogen and helium. They are low in density and have many moons. Uranus and Neptune also have many moons, but they contain mainly water, methane, and ammonia. While it is tempting to call the former two gas giants and the latter two ice giants, such naming is not entirely accurate because, depending on different circumstances, these planets can be a mixture of liquids and gases. Sometimes, liquids and gases are indistinguishable. Another common feature is they lack a solid surface.</p>

        <p>All eight major planets orbit the Sun. Because of their different distances from the Sun, the terrestrial planets take less time to orbit the Sun than the giant planets. For instance, the Earth takes one year, or one Earth year, to orbit the Sun. Neptune takes more than literally 160 Earth years to orbit the Sun, being so far from the Sun, the centre of the Solar System. The eight planets orbit the Sun on roughly the same plane known as the ecliptic. On this plane, the term axial tilt applies to all the planets, and it is defined by the angle between a planet’s own equatorial plane and orbital plane. To put it simply, this angle creates different seasons on Earth every year because the amount of sunshine is different in different parts of the world.</p>

        <p>You may wonder, what else exists other than the Sun and the major planets? There are also dwarf planets, satellites, and small Solar System bodies. One of the famous dwarf planets is Pluto. Within the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond Neptune, Pluto is only one among several similar dwarf planets. Also, Pluto, despite its considerable size, orbits with a very different ecliptic from those of the major planets. Sometimes it is closer to the Sun than Neptune, sometimes it is not. In modern science, Pluto is considered one of the <em>Trans-Neptunian Objects</em> and it is the second largest, after another one called Eris.
