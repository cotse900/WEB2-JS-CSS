# An implementation of Web Wildlife Walk / A5
I did not actually have A5 during my course but I find it aesthetic so I do it here. It is slightly different from A4 since there is a "Card" view of species ("Web Wildlife Walk 2.0"). Another version is the same topic as a final project with "add observation" and upload functions ("Web Wildlife Walk 3.0").
- added "Card" views based on A4 content.
