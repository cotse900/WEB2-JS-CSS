# An implementation of Web Wildlife Walk (2.0+3.0)
The original topic was in 3 parts. Part 1 was A4. Part 2 was A5, since there is a "Card" view of species ("Web Wildlife Walk 2.0"). Part 3 was, further to A5, a final project with "add observation" and upload functions ("Web Wildlife Walk 3.0"). I merge 2.0 and 3.0 here since I find the topic to be beautiful.
- added "Card" views based on A4 content.
- added (borrowed) materials for 3.0. I don't own copyrights to these.
